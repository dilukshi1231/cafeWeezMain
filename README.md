Cafe Weez Website The primary objective of our project is to develop a sophisticated website for cafe shops named "Cafe Weez." The website will facilitate online ordering and delivery for customers.Upon logging into the website, customers will have access to menu prices and other relevant information. They can place orders seamlessly through the online platform. Inside the cafe, the website will incorporate a customer delivery tracking system. Customers seated at tables can conveniently place orders, which will display available food items, prices, and offers.  It will also maintain separate records for daily income, tracking revenue generated both online and in-store. Additionally, the system will keep track of daily purchases and expenses and also collect customer reviews.
